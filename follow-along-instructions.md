# Let's Build a Website
We'll be walking through a build your own website tutorial!

## Workshop Setup
To follow along, you'll need to have 3 things handy:
1. Workshop folder downloaded
2. Atom (text editor) downloaded
3. Netlify account (hosting)

### 1. Workshop Files
Files can be downloaded as a zip file from this link on Github - [LINK TO THE REPO]

### 2. Download Atom
go here to download --> [https://atom.io/](https://atom.io/)

#### What is Atom?
[Atom](https://atom.io/) is a basic text editor and coding environment. This is a tool developers or people who want to edit code use to read and write code.

#### Why do I need to download something?
Built-in text editors like Mac's TextEdit or the typical programs you use to create and edit files like MS Office or Google docs are not built to edit code, and they add a lot of fancy things to our files to make them easy for us to edit. For code, we need a program that doesn't add anything fancy and lets us view and edit the raw contents of our files. And if we download a coding text editor, we'll more easily be able to see the differences in these files and we won't have to worry about our text editor program adding code to our file, under the hood.

This will also better facilitate your learning and will allow you to walk away from the workshop with your computer set up for you to learn or experiment further!

#### Alternative: Codepen
If you're having problems downloading Atom, feel free to follow along in the browser with Codepen - [https://codepen.io/niloca/pen/yLoyWRV](https://codepen.io/niloca/pen/yLoyWRV)


### 3. Sign up for Netlify
1. Go to [https://app.netlify.com/](https://app.netlify.com/)
2. Create Account
  * Select Email Address
  * Follow account creation instructions
  * Skip personalization

#### What is Netlify?
Netlify is a web host, which we'll learn more about in the workshop! We need an account on Netlify so that our site files can live somewhere on the internet. There are many different web hosts under the sun, and for educational and cost purposes, we decided to go with Netlify. Netlify is free.

## Workshop Steps
- Learning and editing code
- Uploading code to web host
- Pointing domain at our live site

### Steps to upload site files to host
1. Click on **Sites**
2. Drag your **Workshop Files** folder into Netlify
3. Netlify will create a URL for your site and post it near the top of the page. Something like: https://loving-nightingale-8bf39f.netlify.app. **Click on your link.**

### Point Domain to Deployed Site
In this example, Name.com will be our domain registrar and Cloudflare will be our DNS. Tools used in this section are Name.com (domain registar for the workshop's urls), Cloudflare, and Netlify. If you already have a domain or want to purchase a domain and want to point it toward your site, be ready with your domain registrar account and a Cloudflare account - [https://www.cloudflare.com/](https://www.cloudflare.com/). Cloudflare is a free tool, so feel free to sign up for an account even if you don't have a domain to learn more.
